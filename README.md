Code for ESP32 client and server and Processing interface that display data.

#Problem

With this project we came up with a solution for a long known problem present on our university: lack of studying spaces.

By using sensors on an Arduino board, connected wirelessly to a server, anyone is able to access, online, the occupancy of each studying room to 
make better decisions and to avoid having to walk the entire campus, up and down.

More on the functioning of the project can be found on the report.
